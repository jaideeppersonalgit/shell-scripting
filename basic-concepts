write down the shell script programs for every concept with explanation


Certainly! Here are some examples of shell script programs that demonstrate different concepts, along with explanations:

Command Line Arguments:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
echo "The first argument is: $1"
echo "The second argument is: $2"
This script displays the first and second command line arguments passed to it when executed.

Loops:
For Loop:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo $i
done
This script prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop.

While Loop:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
  echo $counter
  counter=$((counter + 1))
done
This script prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

Until Loop:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
counter=1
until [ $counter -gt 5 ]; do
  echo $counter
  counter=$((counter + 1))
done
This script prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using an until loop.

Reading from a File:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
file="/path/to/file.txt"
while IFS= read -r line; do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < "$file"
This script reads each line from a file and echoes it.

Process Substitution:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
sort -r <(cat file.txt)
This script uses process substitution to sort the lines of a file in reverse order.

Error Handling:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
set -e
trap 'echo "Error occurred"; exit 1' ERR
# Script commands
This script enables the -e option to exit the script on any error and uses the trap command to catch errors and display a message before exiting.

Environment Variables:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
echo "Home directory: $HOME"
echo "Username: $USER"
This script displays the home directory and username of the current user using environment variables.

Quoting:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
variable="World"
echo 'Hello $variable'   # Output: Hello $variable
echo "Hello $variable"   # Output: Hello World
echo "Today is $(date)"  # Output: Today is [current date and time]
This script demonstrates the use of single quotes, double quotes, and command substitution.

User Input:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
This script prompts the user to enter their name and then displays a greeting using the entered name.

File Existence Check:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
file="/path/to/file.txt"
if [ -e "$file" ]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "File does not exist"
fi
This script checks if a file exists and displays a message accordingly.

String Manipulation:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
name="John"
greeting="Hello, "$name"!"
echo $greeting   # Output: Hello, John!
string="Hello, World!"
echo ${string:0:5}   # Output: Hello
string="Hello"
echo ${#string}   # Output: 5
string="Hello, World!"
if [[ $string =~ ^H.*d!$ ]]; then
  echo "Matches pattern"
fi
This script demonstrates various string manipulation techniques like concatenation, substring extraction, length calculation, and pattern matching.

These examples provide a starting point for understanding different concepts in shell scripting. You can modify and expand upon them based on your specific requirements.
